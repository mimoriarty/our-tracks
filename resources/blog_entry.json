  "text": "It has been 18 years since I moved to live in this area. The forest was a real unknown to me for the first five years. After that I have traveled it hundreds of times, walking, running, cycling. Alone or accompanied at any time of the year./nOn those tours I have had encounters of all kinds with the local fauna. I surprised an eagle standing on a ledge almost within reach of my hand but separated by an impossible jump for me. I have crossed foxes on several occasions, especially in the early hours of the morning. Kites, snakes and rabbits are common, as well as small rodents. Red squirrels that had been missing for quite some time have recently been seen again, and the partridges released a couple of years ago seem to have grown in number./nExploring it thoroughly has led me to understand how much it needs to be preserved. When you walk through it, realize what a gift it is and do your best to leave it at least the same as it was before you arrived.",
